# number-guessing-game
ðŸ‘¦ About Me

I'm 17 years old and just started learning Python.
This is the first project I uploaded to GitHub.
I'm working toward becoming an AI scientist one day!

ðŸŽ® This is my first Python project.  
The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100,  
and the user has to guess it in 10 tries or less!

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Random number generation
- User input with feedback (too high / too low)
- Max 10 attempts
- Win or lose message

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed
2. Download or clone this repo
3. Run the file in terminal or any Python IDE:
   ```bash
   python guessing_game.py
